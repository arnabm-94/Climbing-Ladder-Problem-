# Climbing-Ladder-Problem-
To solve the problem of climbing a ladder with N steps where you can take jumps of 1, 2, or 3 steps, use dynamic programming. Build the solution from the bottom up, starting at step 0 and working up to step N. This approach efficiently calculates the number of ways to reach the top by considering all possible jumps at each step.
